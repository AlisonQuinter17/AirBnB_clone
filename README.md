<img src="https://github.com/AlisonQuinter17/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/multimedia/console.gif" class="responsive"/>

## Description
In this repository we develop the first step in the construction of our first complete web application: the AirBnB clone, which consists in the creation of a custom command interpreter that allows us to manage and store AirBnB objects.

This first step is very important because it will help us develop the next steps in which we will implement: HTML / CSS templates, database storage, API, front-end integration ...

**This project is part of the Holberton School Full-Stack Software Engineer program.**
